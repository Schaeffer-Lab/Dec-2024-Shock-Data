#momentum pz vs z, convert pz to vz, plot that as a function of z, do it for electrons and ions, 
#both ambient and target, 4 separate plots

#charge density, multiply by -1

#histogram for velocity and position, bins, binning 10 or 100 cells in z, velocity doesnt 
#have a bin, bin it by .005c, 
#1 bin = 1 ion upstreaminertial length, 
# delta v = 0.01c
# ion is 0.001c
# 

# do similar plots, but zoom in between 20000 and 40000
# plot those 

#Ex,y,z

#Bx,y,z
